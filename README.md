# PreferenceFlows2016

I wanted to make this tool in time for the 2019 Federal Election. I hope people will use it to understand how their senate preferences flow.

Assuming that there are no errors, this should be pretty much the final version before the election.

There is more that could be done. For example, elections from previous years, or state senate elections could be included. I doubt I will do this before the next election though. Especially since the previous elections were performed under the old rules, with parties in control of above the line preference votes. While not too difficult to include these elections, I suspect having elections performed under different rules on this site could be unneccessarily confusing for the casual user.

However, if I do add anything, it will be how the preferences would have flowed if the election had been a DD election. The AEC publishes the results of this hypothetical election, in order to help calculate which senators serve full terms and which senators serve half terms after the DD. Furthermore, I intend to update the website once the results of the 2019 election.
